      <p>
        Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, 
        provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Established in the United Kingdom 
        in 1919, its main aim is to improve the lives of children through better education, health care, 
        and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts.
